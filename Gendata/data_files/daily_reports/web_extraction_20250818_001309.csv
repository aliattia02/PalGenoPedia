Also killed were freelance cameraman Momen Aliwa and freelance journalist Mohammed al-Khalidi.

Translation: Nonstop bombing… For the past two hours, the Israeli aggression on Gaza City has intensified. In a final message, written on April 6, to be published in the event of his death, al-Sharif said he “lived the pain in all its details” and “tasted grief and loss repeatedly”. “Despite that, I never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who remained silent, those who accepted our killing, and those who suffocated our very breaths,” he said. “Not even the mangled bodies of our children and women moved their hearts or stopped the massacre that our people have been subjected to for over a year and a half.” Advertisement Advertisement The reporter also expressed sorrow for having had to leave his wife, Bayan, behind, and for not seeing his son, Salah, and daughter, Sham, grow up. “This attack comes amid the catastrophic consequences of the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza, which has seen the relentless slaughter of civilians, forced starvation, and the obliteration of entire communities,” ",28,0,28,0,0,,,,Al Jazeera,verified,children|journalist|medical|civilian|airstrike,2025-08-17T22:13:08.589728,0,
